    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gazpacho is a cold soup with various ingredients such as olive oil,
        vinegar, water, raw vegetables, usually tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and garlic.</p>
    <p>It is usually served fresh in the hot summer months. Its color varies from pale orange to red,
        depending on whether more or less ripe tomatoes are used.</p>
    <p>The original gazpacho (a mixture of crumbled bread, olive oil and vinegar)
        has been feeding Iberian farmers in the south for centuries. </p>
    <p>This evolution has left over time varieties of gazpacho in southern Spain and Portugal,
        the most popular and internationalized being the so-called Andalusian gazpacho.</p>
