    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>3 potatoes (600 gr)</li>
        <li>1 small onion</li>
        <li>1 green pepper</li>
        <li>2 glasses of oliva oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>1 leaf of parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and chop the onion into medium dice. Clean the green pepper, remove the stem and the seeds and cut it into cubes.
        </li>
        <li>If the potatoes are dirty, pass them through water. Peel them, cut them in half lengthwise, then cut each piece into thin 1/2-inch half moons.
        </li>
        <li>Put everything in the pan, season to your liking and fry over low heat for 25-30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the fry and drain it. Pass the oil to a container and reserve it. Clean the pan with absorbent kitchen paper.
        </li>
        <li>Crack the eggs, place them in a large bowl, and beat. Salt them to your liking, add the fried potatoes, onion and pepper and mix well.
        </li>
        <li>Place the pan back on the heat, add a drizzle of the reserved oil, and add the mixture. Stir a little with a wooden spoon and wait (20 seconds) for it to start to curdle.
        </li>
        <li>Separate the edges, cover the pan with a plate that is larger in diameter than the pan, and flip it over.
        </li>
        <li>Throw it again so that it curdles on the other side.
        </li>
    </ol>
