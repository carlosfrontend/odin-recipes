In this project, a basic template in **HTML language** has been used to create several pages with recipes.

The following concepts of this language have been used for its development:

* Boilerplate HTML
* Use of headings tags ```h1, h2, h3```
* To insert images with image tag ``` <img src="./images/sample.jpeg" alt="My sample image"/>```
* Working with links tags ``` <a href="./relativePath.html">Link</a>```
* Use of lists:
    * Unordered lists:
        ```
        <ul>
            <li>Content1</li>
            <li>Content2</li>
            <li>Content3</li>
        </ul>
        ```
    * Ordered lists:
        ```
        <ol>
            <li>Content1</li>
            <li>Content2</li>
            <li>Content3</li>
        </ol>
        ```

#### Happy Coding!!! :heart:
